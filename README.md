# Shipping_Website

this is a project from my University.
I have used sqlite for  database.
js for frontend. 
node js for back end and client server connections, also to manage queries on db .
I have used nicepage to develop the UI (html and css) to speed up the development time. 
If you have any inquires you know where to reach me. 

good luck!
